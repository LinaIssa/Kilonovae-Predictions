In this repository are gathered all the python scripts and notebooks used to carry out a post treatment analysis of POSSIS simulation outputs and various tasks such as testing the validity of models, etc.   

- Creation_Model_Grid.ipynb, model_grid.ipynb and model_grid.py: python script used for creating a model grid and notebooks for checkups and tests.
- comparaison_new_original.py	: a python script to explore the difference between two models in terms of lightcurves predictions 
- lc.py	and the updated version lc2.py: a script to plot light curves from POSSIS outputs 			
- plot_eps.ipynb and plot_spectra.ipynb: notebooks for plotting some physical models included in the Monte-Carlo POSSIS simulation 
- contribution_direct_photons.py: script to perform data exploration on the outputs of POSSIS simulation  
- mapping_photons_just_created.ipynb: analysis performed on key checkpoints of POSSIS 
- data.ipynb: retrieving relevant data informations 			
- energy_depo.ipynb: implementing a new physical model to improve the accurary of POSSIS 
- temp_profile.ipynb and temp_new_profile.ipynb: plotting the temperature profile from POSSIS results 
- stage2.py and the updated version plotUtilities.py: useful graphics functionnalities that are used in my scripts and notebooks
