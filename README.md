This research project was carried out as part of a 9-month internship, from October 2019 to July 2020, at Nordita in Stockholm, under the supervision of Mattia Bulla. 

During this internship, I have been using a Monte Carlo based radiative transfer code, POSSIS, written in C and developed by my supervisor in 2015. This code can provide predictions of kilonova models relying on numerical and physical simulations of photon propagation. I have made significant improvements by upgrading the physics behind the code so that it can provide less model-dependent kilonova predictions. 

This project revolves around optimizing the treatment of free paramters used in temperature and opacity models. The source code and the post treatment analysis of the temperature and the opacity are in the TemperatureAnalysis repository and, respectively, in the OpacityAnalysis. In TimedelayAnalysis, the source code POSSIS alongside with some data analysis tools aim at characterizing  the impact of the geometry induced time delay upon the time arrival of photons. 

A more in-depth analysis of the physical outcomes of POSSIS can be found in the Report repository.
