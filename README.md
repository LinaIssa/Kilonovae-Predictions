This research project was carried out as part of a 9-month internship, from October 2019 to July 2020, at Nordita in Stockholm, under the supervision of Mattia Bulla. 

During this internship, I have been using a Monte Carlo based radiative transfer code, POSSIS, written in C and developed by my supervisor in 2015. This code can provide predictions of kilonova models relying on numerical and physical simulations of photon propagation. I have made significant improvements by upgrading the physics behind the code so that it can porvode models-independent kilonova predictions.
